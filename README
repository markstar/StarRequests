StarRequests is a library of modular common requests and utilities built using AS3-Signals.
The main concept is to make each request modular using a consistent interface to enable the creation of useful generic utilities.
There will be some posts on StarRequests in the future on http://markstar.co.uk, to explain the ideas behind it and show some examples of how to use the library.
